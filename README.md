# Intermediate source control in Xcode 5 
## Sample Project - ControllingSource
-------------------------------------
This is the sample project for the __Intermediate source control in Xcode 5__ chapter from iOS 7 by Tutorials, available at [Ray Wenderlich](http://www.raywenderlich.com/).

This version was modified by [Dan Wells](https://github.com/danwells) per instructions for the challenge at the end of Chapter 13.  Specifically, the challenge asks for 5 additional quotes in the plist resource and to add a .gitignore file.
